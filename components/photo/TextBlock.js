                            The Wanderlust Women is a hiking and outdoor activity group for
                            Muslim women that aims to empower and enable people from
                            different ethnic backgrounds and cultures to access the outdoors
                            through group hikes and events, harnessing the power of
                            representation and education to diversify the face of adventure.
                            On Sunday the 10th of April, the second weekend of Ramadan, the
                            group invited Muslims and non-Muslims alike to celebrate this
                            special period in the Islamic calendar. They would hike and
                            share culture, belief and community together in the English Lake
                            District.

                            Beneath Helvellyn , perhaps the regionâ€™s most popular mountain,
                            the picturesque village of Glenridding served as base camp for
                            the event, which began with introductions in the village hall, a
                            short talk about the significance of the period to Muslims and
                            the intrinsic connection between faith and nature, followed by
                            an opportunity to ask questions.

                            talked openly about their experiences of relocating to an area
                            of the country infamous for its lack of diversity, the
                            importance of understanding and celebrating differences and the
                            bonds that can be formed through a mutual love of the outdoors.
